It's time to review day four.
Roll the tape! 
We checked in with Raj on how you can organize your iPad interface with SwiftUI.
- Better support for state restoration, deep linking, and even richer programmatic control.
- Cool.
- Then Sara showed us how to bring the power of SwiftUI to your UIKit apps.
- You can use the hosting controller anywhere you can use a view controller in UIKit.
- Later on, Brett took us through the latest updates for Vision.
- Here we compute optical flow for a short clip of this dog fetching a water bottle on a beach.
- And we discovered how to create compelling SharePlay experiences.
- Think of SharePlay like a portal, transporting people through their phones and into the same space.
- We also got a lesson in language from Apple's interface writers.
- Writing for interfaces begins with curiosity for who's on the other side of the screen.
- And now for the intel on day five.

Check back in tomorrow for our final report.
