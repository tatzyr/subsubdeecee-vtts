Phew! 
What a ride we’ve had at Dub Dub.
Here’s your recap! 
♪ "Better Days (Instrumental)" by DARKMINDS ♪ 
We learned how to create apps for research and care...
- We can provide educational text from the clinicians.
- This cutting-edge research is going to help so many people.
-...And discovered how to design for Safari 15’s tab bar and incorporate visual intelligence.
- Well that's what we've done in Safari 15.
- Beautiful! 
We also explored how to build Mac apps with SwiftUI...
- These APIs and concepts apply to all platforms.
- ...and said hello to CloudKit Console.
- The next time I launch the console, it will bring me straight to the last container I visited.
- Wow! How is it Friday already? 
There was just so much: async/await, Xcode Cloud, SharePlay, Metal, Mindful Cooldowns for coding, watchOS, Tiera Fletcher’s amazing talk, Xcode, gaming, accessibility... 
We hope you had a great week and cannot wait to see what you make this fall.
Ciao!
